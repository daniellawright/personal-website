🌸 You can use my personal website as a template!
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/daniellawright/personal-website
Open index.html and customize with your content!

All images should be optimized before committing
Keep images around 800×800 px or smaller
Use WebP whenever possible, with PNG/JPG as a backup

To optimize images automatically:
Run ./optimize-images.sh (make sure ImageMagick is installed)
Use the <picture> tag in your HTML for WebP + fallback images
